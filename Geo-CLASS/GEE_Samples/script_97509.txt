////////////////////////* Step 1: Visualize pre and post fire images */////////////////////

// We will load in two pre-selected images captured over the affected area. 

// They were collected approximately one year apart 

// Our pre fire image is from 2017 

// Our post fire image is from 2018. 

// We are using Landsat imagery, which is a very important series of satellites that has

// shaped how we understand the Earth. The pixel size is 30 meters. 



// Load in pre-fire image 

var preImg = ee.Image('LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_SR/LC08_045033_20170925')

// Load in post fire image

var postImg = ee.Image('LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_SR/LC08_045033_20180928')



// Let's check some information about these images 

print('preImage information',preImg)

print('postImage information', postImg)

// Check your Console to view the information

//*CQ* can you figure out a way to list the band names in the console? 

// Hint - check bandNames function







// A true color image display is how you would expect to see everything in the 

// real world. The trees are green, water is blue/green, buildings are white and grey. 

var vizTC = {bands: ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'], min: 0, max: 6000, gamma: 2};

/* We need to center the map display on our area otherwise we won't be able to 

see the image when we add it */ 

Map.centerObject(preImg,9)

// display map layers 

Map.addLayer(preImg, vizTC, 'pre image true color');

Map.addLayer(postImg, vizTC, 'post image true color');





/* Now we will change to a band display to false color infrared 

It is common for examining vegetation which will now show up as bright red. */



// *UC*  display CIR













// Change to a false color SWIR

// Vegetation will be bright green, soil ares will be brown, water will be dark



// *UC* display false swir
